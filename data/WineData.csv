1896,Spain,"Pinched, rubbery and earthy-smelling, but with ample berry, plum and char aromas, this young, oak-aged RDD is full and well balanced.

1903,US,"Blended from several stellar vineyard sites, including La Cruz and Devoto, this wine presents a brightness of acidity and crisp, red fruit. These are offset by a heartier uptake of oak and tannin that feels out of place compared to many of the producer's single-vineyard offerings. On the finish, expect tart cranberry and pomegranate to peak.",,87,32,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Zepaltas
1904,US,"Equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot finished off with 5% Cabernet Franc, this cool-vintage wine is light in color. Notes of plum and cranberries come with herb and floral accents.

1906,US,"Scents of lemon-cake icing meet the pretty yet not treacly tropical aromatics of white flowers on this barely off-dry wine.

1907,US,"This smells oaky and tastes ripe and pure, like crushed blackberries and raspberries. It feels plush and smooth in the mouth, finishing on the soft side.

1909,US,"This tastes honest, clean and direct, with a nice mixture of fruity, woody and savory herbal aromas and flavors.

A tasty raspberry note gives it even more personality.",,87,11,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Zinfandel,McManis

1926,US,"Some ageable Cabs are lovely to drink on release. Not this one. It's tough in tannins, with a gum-stinging astringency. Below all that are ripe, concentrated blackberry jam and cassis flavors. Blended with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, it's already throwing some sediment, a good sign, which means you won't have to wait 20 years for it to come around. Pop that cork after 2018.",,90,125,California,Napa,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Juslyn Vineyards

Drink now.",Grand Reserve,90,28,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Kendall-Jackson
1929,US,"There's something old-fashioned about this blend of all five classic Bordeaux varieties. Partly it's the tannins, which are brusque, and partly it's the alcohol, which is low. On the other hand, the fruit is ripe in the modern style, brimming with raspberries and cherries, and there's plenty of fancy new French oak. It's a pretty wine to drink now through 2020.",,90,60,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Meritage,Kings Mountain

1941,US,"Given the difficulties of the 2010 vintage, this wine is a success. The tannins are young, thick and astringent, and then the acids kick in. After that initial assault, the palate begins to get more interesting complexities of black currants, blueberries, minerals and oak. The suggestion is ageability, but only limited. Give it until 2016â€“2017 years and drink with hearty fare.",,90,95,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Coup de Foudre

1946,US,"A small planting of an unusual â€œUprightâ€ clone yields this fragrant, smoky, lightly earthy Pinot Noir.

1947,US,"This is a tannic, acidic, hard-to-appreciate wine due to the cold conditions of the 2011 vintage. But the wine, which is 100% Cabernet and was aged in 50% new French oak, still is a great success, testimony to skillful viticultural and winemaking practices. With a solid core of black currants, it wants until 2020 in the cellar.",Maxine's Vineyard,90,55,California,Yountville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bardessono

1951,Spain,"Plum and berry aromas are lively and come with a mild scent of animal fur.

1958,Spain,"Blackberry, cherry and earthy aromas are backed by a secondary wave of oaky char. This is 80% Garnacha and 20% Carignan with raw clamp to the palate created by grabby tannins and tomatoey acidity. Briny raspberry and plum flavors finish with rubbery tannins and related grab. This is a tough wine but one with lots of life and power. Drink through 2019.",Pinyolet SelecciÃ³n,88,19,Catalonia,Montsant,,Red Blend,CompaÃ±ia de Vinos del AtlÃ¡ntico

1961,France,"This wine starts off a bit tarry or rubbery, but with airing that dissipates to reveal a dry, savory, complex rosÃ©.

1964,US,"Made from a majority of Cabernet Franc, complemented with a small handful of Merlot, the wine is aged in new French oak half barrels.

1965,France,"Pure NÃ©grette produces a smooth, black cherry and red berry-flavored wine. Light hints of wood from aging in big barrels have helped to give the wine a rich and spicy character.

1966,Spain,"Apple, peach and melon aromas are fresh and easy to like. This has a pure palate, with citric and malic acidity offset by pulpy weight.

1968,Italy,"A hearty blend of Merlot and Cabernet, this opens with aromas of cedar, vanilla, underbrush and black currant.

1973,Italy,"Made from the native grape Pugnitello, this hearty red opens with aromas of dried Mediterranean herbs, scorched earth, allspice and overripe black fruit. The warm, forward palate doles out baked plum, ripe blackberries, blue flowers, clove and the heat of evident alcohol.

1979,France,"With vines in the northeast of the Gers region, this winery produces impressively ripe red wines.

1987,US,"Old Wente clones drive the richness of this wine, a mix of lemon, oak and fennel, with a touch of spice on the finish.

1991,US,"This is a rich, broad-shouldered Pinot Noir, woodsy and oaky with a firm and fierce grip on the palate. It leans more toward earth and smoke than exuberant fruit.

2022,Spain,"This is one of the most inky, concentrated, fiercely tannic vintages of Alion to date. Aromas of granite, boysenberry and grilled meat feed into a biting, full-bodied palate that can only benefit from more time.

2260,US,"This vintage of the winery's Sauvignon Blanc doesn't reflect the tropicality that's started to define the region.

2734,France,"Lifted notes of dried pear, dried chamomile flowers and dried lemon peel have a strong impact. The palate comes in with lovely generous sweetness that amplifies that chamomile-tisane notion and boosts the dried-fruit notes. Against the distinctly medium-sweet fruitiness stands a clarion line of acidity. The evolution of fruit flavors weaves a colorful tapestry of aromas. This is carefully balanced and quietly intense. It holds immense strength at its core that radiates flavor and fruit. Made from a field blend of Alsace varieties, each adds something: aroma, texture, freshness and body.

The medium-sweet palate impresses with both fresh and dried notes of fruit: plum, white sultana, white currant and the ripest pear and apple you can imagine. This is full-on and big but balanced by tingling, fresh and precise acidity. A field blend of polar opposites, Riesling and Gewurztraminer, this unites their virtues of aromatic textured richness and poised finesse. Again, this is not a wine that is easily categorized with its medium-sweet, soil- and fruit-driven profile, but it is a joy to experience and savor. The finish lasts and lasts.

There is something stern and stony at the core, something fundamental and profound. The body is precise, dry and powerful and incredibly moreish.

2948,Spain,"Fresh plum and berry aromas are cut from a common mold. This is a good but typical juicy Rioja with clean fruit, crisp acidity and nice cherry and raspberry flavors. A touch of bitterness comes up at the tail end of the finish.",,87,11,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Monte Clavijo
2949,US,"This is a well-constructed, with 95% of the grapes from Napa Valley and the rest supplied from nearby Lake County. Merlot makes up 85% of the wine; the remainder is Cabernet Sauvignon.

A fresh, easygoing selection, this concludes with a clean, medium-length finish.",,87,26,Virginia,Monticello,,Viognier,King Family
2959,US,"This is an expansive, fuller-style of Chardonnay from windswept Carneros. Juicy in apple and Meyer lemon, it's softly textured, with a pronounced richness in aroma, evocative of earthy oak and petrol.

2970,Spain,"This smells a touch stalky and leathery, although there's ample black fruit character to the bouquet.

2990,Italy,"Aromas that recall stewed prune, cherry steeped in spirits, baking spice, toast and a whiff of menthol lead the nose and carry through to the firm palate along with notes of coffee, grilled sage and clove.
